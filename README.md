## Description
My motivation for this project was to develop a functional and user-friendly application that seamlessly integrates the front end with a robust back end, providing a reliable note-taking solution for users.I built this project to fulfill the challenge of creating a note-taking application with a back end using Express.js, aiming to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to write and save notes.The Note Taker application solves the problem of organizing and storing notes by providing users with a digital platform where they can easily write, save, and retrieve their notes, eliminating the need for physical notepads or scattered digital files.Through the process of building the Note Taker application, I learned how to effectively integrate a front end with an Express.js back end, handle data storage and retrieval using a JSON file, and deploy the application to Heroku, enhancing my skills in full-stack web development and deployment.
